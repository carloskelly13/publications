### Publications

#### A web app for screen layout and print design.

Publications is a TypeScript–based Express app that serves the GraphQL–platform and React–based client app. The GraphQL–platform is backed by PostgreSQL.

#### Getting Started

To run the GraphQL-platform and React–based client app:

```
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

In development mode this assumes you have a PostgreSQL database named `publications`, a role that manages it named `publications` with the password `publications`. The app runs on port `4000` with hot module replacement enabled.

#### Maintenance Status
This project is no longer actively developed with new features but dependencies are updated to ensure the app still works on modern systems.
